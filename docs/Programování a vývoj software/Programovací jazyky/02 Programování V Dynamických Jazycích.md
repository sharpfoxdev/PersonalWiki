# 02 Programování V Dynamických Jazycích

## Typové Mechanismy Dynamických Jazyků

Dynamic programming languages such as Python, Ruby, and JavaScript use dynamic type systems, which offer several distinct mechanisms and features:

### Duck Typing

- **Principle:** "If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck." Dynamic languages often do not require explicit type definitions; instead, an object's methods and properties determine its type.
- **Application:** Enables the use of generic programming techniques, where the specific type of an object is less important than the methods it supports.

### Late Binding

- **Description:** The method to be invoked or the property to be accessed on an object is determined at runtime instead of at compile time.
- **Benefit:** Increases flexibility by allowing objects of different types to be used interchangeably, as long as they support the expected interface or behavior.

### Type Inference

- **Description:** The language interpreter automatically deduces the type of a variable or expression based on the assigned value or how the variable is used.
- **Example:** In Python, `my_var = 42` automatically assigns `my_var` the type `int` without explicit type declaration.

### Dynamic Typing

- **Characteristic:** Variables are not bound to a specific type, and the type of data a variable refers to can change over time.
- **Implication:** Reduces boilerplate code for type declarations but requires careful management to avoid type-related runtime errors.

### Reflection

- **Feature:** Programs can inspect and modify their structure and behavior at runtime. This includes creating new types, invoking methods, and accessing properties dynamically.
- **Use Cases:** Used in metaprogramming, dynamic dispatch, and implementing features such as object serialization and deserialization.

### Type Conversion and Coercion

- **Automatic Conversion:** Dynamic languages often automatically convert types during operations (type coercion), e.g., converting an integer to a float when performing division.
- **Explicit Conversion:** Programmers can also explicitly convert types using built-in functions or methods, ensuring the correct type is used for an operation.

### Advantages and Challenges

- **Advantages:** Increased development speed, code conciseness, and ease of use for rapid prototyping and scripting.
- **Challenges:** Potential for runtime errors due to type mismatches, which necessitates thorough testing and sometimes runtime type checking to ensure reliability.

## Duck-typing

Duck-typing is a type system used in dynamic languages that focuses on the methods and properties of an object rather than its actual type. This approach allows for more generic and flexible code, where the compatibility of an object is determined by the presence of certain methods or properties, not by the type of the object itself.

### Principle

- The principle behind duck-typing is that the usability of an object is determined by the methods it implements or the properties it exposes, not by its inheritance hierarchy or the interface it implements.

### Advantages

- **Flexibility:** Duck-typing allows for more adaptable and flexible code. Functions and methods can operate on any object that supports the expected interface, regardless of the object's type.
- **Simplicity:** It simplifies the code by eliminating the need for complex type hierarchies and interface implementations, focusing instead on the essential behavior of the objects.
- **Ease of Use:** Promotes rapid development and testing, as objects can easily be substituted or mocked based on their behavior.

### Examples in Dynamic Languages

#### Python Example

```python
class Duck:
    def quack(self):
        print("Quack, quack!")

class Person:
    def quack(self):
        print("I'm quacking like a duck!")

def make_it_quack(ducky):
    ducky.quack()

duck = Duck()
person = Person()

# Both calls are valid due to duck-typing
make_it_quack(duck)
make_it_quack(person)
```

In this example, both `Duck` and `Person` objects are passed to `make_it_quack` function, demonstrating duck-typing by focusing on the behavior (`quack` method) rather than the type of the object.

### Considerations

- **Runtime Errors:** While duck-typing enhances flexibility, it can lead to runtime errors if objects do not implement the expected behavior, necessitating thorough testing.
- **Documentation and Readability:** Clear documentation and naming conventions become crucial to maintain readability and understandability of the code, as explicit type information is not available.

## Prototypy

Prototypal inheritance is a feature of dynamic languages where objects can directly inherit properties and methods from other objects. This approach contrasts with the classical inheritance model, where inheritance is defined through classes.

### Concept of Prototypes

- In prototypal inheritance, each object has a prototype object from which it can inherit properties and methods. An object's prototype is itself an object, creating a prototype chain that is traversed when accessing properties or methods.

### Advantages of Prototypal Inheritance

- **Simplicity:** Objects can be created and extended on the fly without needing a class definition.
- **Flexibility:** It's easy to add or change properties and methods at runtime, making the objects highly adaptable.
- **Dynamic Relationships:** The prototype chain can be altered dynamically, affecting all objects inheriting from the modified prototype.

### JavaScript Prototypes

JavaScript is the most prominent language that utilizes prototypal inheritance. Every JavaScript object has a prototype from which it inherits properties.
- **Creating Objects with Prototypes:**

    ```javascript
    const animal = {
        isAlive: true
    };

    // Creating an object that inherits from 'animal'
    const dog = Object.create(animal);
    dog.bark = function() {
        console.log('Woof!');
    };

    dog.bark(); // Outputs: Woof!
    console.log(dog.isAlive); // Outputs: true
    ```

- **Prototype Chain:** When accessing a property or method of an object, JavaScript looks up the property on the object first; if it doesn't find it, it searches the object's prototype, and so on up the prototype chain.

### Prototypal Inheritance Patterns

- **Prototype Delegation:** Objects delegate behavior to their prototype. This is the default behavior in JavaScript.
- **Concatenative Inheritance (Cloning):** Objects are created by copying the properties of an existing object without retaining a live link.
- **Functional Inheritance:** Using functions to create objects and implement inheritance, allowing for more privacy and encapsulation.

### Considerations

- **Performance:** While flexible, dynamically modifying prototypes can impact performance, particularly when changes occur deep in the prototype chain.
- **Debugging:** The dynamic nature of prototypal inheritance can make debugging more challenging, as it might be less obvious where a particular property or method is defined in the prototype chain.

## Imutabilní Typy

Immutable types play a pivotal role in dynamic programming languages by ensuring that objects remain unchanged once they have been instantiated. This concept is particularly relevant in functional programming paradigms and languages that emphasize immutability for reliability and performance.

### What Makes a Type Immutable?

- An immutable type is one whose instances cannot be altered once they are created. Common examples include strings, tuples, and numbers in languages like Python and JavaScript.

### Advantages of Immutability

- **Predictability:** Code becomes more predictable and easier to understand, as the state of immutable objects does not change unexpectedly.
- **Concurrency:** Immutability is inherently thread-safe, making it easier to write concurrent applications without worrying about data races or synchronization issues.
- **Caching:** Immutable objects are ideal candidates for caching since their state cannot change, ensuring that cached data remains consistent.
- **Functional Programming:** Immutability supports the principles of functional programming, where functions do not have side effects and always produce the same output for the same input.

### Examples in Dynamic Languages

#### Python

```python
# Strings in Python are immutable
str1 = "Hello"
str2 = str1.replace("H", "J")
print(str1)  # Outputs: Hello
print(str2)  # Outputs: Jello
```

In this example, modifying `str1` does not change the original string but returns a new string with the modification.

```js
const str = "Hello";
// Attempting to change an individual character results in an error
str[0] = "J"; // Does nothing in non-strict mode, throws an error in strict mode
console.log(str); // Outputs: Hello
```

JavaScript strings are immutable, so attempts to modify them do not alter the original string.

### Working with Immutable Types

- **Design Patterns:** Utilize design patterns that embrace immutability, such as using factories to create new instances rather than modifying existing ones.
- **Functional Techniques:** Apply functional programming techniques, emphasizing functions that return new objects rather than altering the state of existing objects.

### Considerations and Challenges

- **Performance:** While immutability can simplify concurrency, creating new instances rather than modifying existing ones may incur performance and memory overhead.
- **Learning Curve:** Programmers accustomed to mutable types may need to adjust their thinking and approach to effectively utilize immutable types.

## Boxing/Unboxing

Boxing and unboxing refer to the processes of converting a value type to a reference type (boxing) and converting a reference type back into a value type (unboxing). These operations bridge the gap between the value-type semantics of primitives and the reference-type semantics of object instances.

### Understanding Boxing

- **Boxing** is the process of wrapping a value type (e.g., an integer or a boolean) in an object so it can be treated as a reference type. This is often used to store value types in data structures that hold objects or to pass value types by reference.
- In dynamic languages that are typically object-oriented (like Python or Ruby), value types are often automatically treated as objects, diminishing the need for explicit boxing. However, understanding this concept is crucial when these languages interact with statically typed languages or runtimes (e.g., interfacing Python with C# through IronPython).

### Understanding Unboxing

- **Unboxing** is the reverse process, extracting the value type from an object wrapper. This operation is type-specific and can result in runtime errors if the types do not match.
- In dynamic languages, explicit unboxing is less common, but understanding the concept is essential for performance considerations and when working with low-level system operations or external statically typed libraries.

### Implications and Considerations

- **Performance:** Boxing and unboxing can have significant performance implications. Boxing involves creating a new object, which consumes heap memory and requires garbage collection. Frequent boxing and unboxing can lead to memory pressure and decreased application performance.
- **Type Safety:** Unboxing requires an explicit cast, which can fail at runtime if the types do not match, leading to potential exceptions.
- **Interoperability:** In environments where dynamic languages interact with statically typed languages (e.g., .NET or JVM ecosystems), understanding boxing and unboxing is critical for seamless data exchange and manipulation.

### Examples in Statically Typed Contexts

#### C\#

```csharp
int i = 123;
// Boxing
object o = i;  // The integer is boxed
// Unboxing
int j = (int)o;  // Explicit unboxing
```

### Relevance in Dynamic Languages

- While dynamic languages typically abstract away the difference between value types and reference types, scenarios involving interoperability with statically typed languages, performance optimization, and low-level memory management may necessitate a deeper understanding of these concepts.
- Understanding the underlying memory and type conversion operations can lead to more optimized code, especially in performance-critical applications.
