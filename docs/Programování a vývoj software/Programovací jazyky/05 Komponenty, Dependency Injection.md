# 05 Komponenty, Dependency Injection

## Vlastnosti a Účel Komponent

Components are self-contained units within a software system that encapsulate a set of related functions or data. They interact with other components through well-defined interfaces, allowing for the creation of complex systems from simpler, reusable pieces.

### Key Features of Components

- **Encapsulation:** Components hide their internal implementation details and expose functionality only through interfaces, promoting loose coupling between different parts of the system.
- **Reusability:** By encapsulating functionality in discrete units, components can be reused across different parts of an application or even in different projects, reducing code duplication and development effort.
- **Interchangeability:** Components can be easily replaced with alternative implementations as long as they adhere to the same interface, facilitating flexibility and experimentation in development.
- **Testability:** The modular nature of components makes it easier to test individual parts of the system in isolation, improving test coverage and reliability.

### Purpose of Components

- **Modularity:** Components break down complex software systems into manageable pieces, simplifying development, maintenance, and understanding of the code.
- **Maintainability:** Encapsulating functionality within components makes it easier to update and improve parts of the system without affecting unrelated areas, enhancing long-term maintainability.
- **Scalability:** Component-based architectures support scaling systems by adding or enhancing individual components without the need to refactor the entire application.

## Dependency Injection (DI)

Dependency Injection is a design pattern that facilitates the implementation of component-based architectures by managing the creation of dependencies outside the components themselves.

### Key Aspects of Dependency Injection

- **Inversion of Control (IoC):** DI shifts the responsibility of creating dependencies from the components to an external entity (often called an IoC container), promoting loose coupling and greater flexibility.
- **Configuration Over Hardcoding:** Dependencies are typically configured externally (e.g., via configuration files or annotations), allowing for changes in the system's composition without modifying the component's source code.
- **Lifecycle Management:** DI frameworks often manage the lifecycle of components and their dependencies, ensuring that resources are appropriately allocated and released.

### Benefits of Using DI

- **Decoupling:** DI reduces the dependency between components, making the system more modular and easier to modify or extend.
- **Ease of Testing:** By injecting mock implementations or stubs of dependencies, components can be tested in isolation, improving testability.
- **Flexibility:** Changing the behavior of a system at runtime or during deployment becomes easier by altering the dependencies that are injected, without needing to change the component's code.

In C#, components are often designed as classes with clearly defined boundaries and interfaces, adhering to principles like Single Responsibility and Separation of Concerns to ensure each component has a distinct role within the application.

### Example of a Component in C\#

Consider a simple `EmailService` component that sends emails. This component can be defined as follows:

```csharp
public interface IEmailService
{
    void SendEmail(string to, string subject, string body);
}

public class EmailService : IEmailService
{
    private readonly ISmtpClient _smtpClient;

    public EmailService(ISmtpClient smtpClient)
    {
        _smtpClient = smtpClient; // Dependency is injected via constructor
    }

    public void SendEmail(string to, string subject, string body)
    {
        // Implementation for sending an email
        _smtpClient.Send(to, subject, body);
    }
}
```

In this example, `EmailService` depends on another component, `ISmtpClient`, for sending emails. Instead of creating an `ISmtpClient` instance directly within `EmailService`, the dependency is injected through the constructor, following the Dependency Injection principle.

### Applying Dependency Injection in C\#

Dependency Injection in C# is commonly managed by a DI container, which automatically resolves dependencies and injects them into components at runtime. The .NET Core and .NET 5+ frameworks provide built-in support for DI through the `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection` namespace.

#### Configuring DI Container in C\#

To use DI with the `EmailService` component, you would configure the DI container in the startup of your application, typically in the `Startup.cs` or `Program.cs` file, depending on the version of .NET:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddTransient<ISmtpClient, SmtpClientImplementation>();
    services.AddTransient<IEmailService, EmailService>();
}
```

This configuration tells the DI container to create a new instance of `SmtpClientImplementation` and `EmailService` whenever they are requested. The container automatically injects the `ISmtpClient` instance into the `EmailService` when it's instantiated.

### Benefits of Using DI

- **Loose Coupling:** Components are less dependent on the concrete implementations of their dependencies, making the system more flexible and easier to modify or extend.
- **Improved Testability:** By injecting mock or stub implementations of dependencies, components can be easily tested in isolation.
- **Simplified Management:** The DI container handles the lifecycle and dependencies of components, reducing the complexity of object creation and management.

## Prostředky pro Popis Komponent

In software engineering, the description of components encompasses various forms, including documentation, diagrams, interface definitions, and metadata annotations. These descriptions serve as a blueprint for the system, outlining how components fit together and interact.

### Documentation

- **Purpose:** Provides a written explanation of the component's functionality, its role within the system, and how it should be used.
- **Tools:** Markdown files, inline code comments, and software documentation tools like Doxygen for C++ or XML Comments for C#.

### Interface Definitions

- **Purpose:** Define the methods and properties that other components can interact with, serving as a contract that ensures the component can be used without knowledge of its internal implementation.
- **Examples:** Interface definitions in languages like Java and C# use the `interface` keyword. In dynamically typed languages like Python, "duck typing" often serves a similar purpose, though explicit interfaces can also be defined using Abstract Base Classes (ABCs).

### UML Diagrams

- **Purpose:** Visual representation of components, their relationships, and interactions using the Unified Modeling Language (UML). UML diagrams can include class diagrams, component diagrams, and sequence diagrams.
- **Tools:** Software like Microsoft Visio, Lucidchart, and open-source alternatives like PlantUML.

### Dependency Descriptions

- **Purpose:** Specify the dependencies of a component, often used in conjunction with Dependency Injection (DI) frameworks to manage component instantiation and wiring.
- **Examples:** 
  - **C#/.NET:** Attributes and conventions in the `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection` library.
  - **Java:** Annotations in Spring Framework, such as `@Autowired`, or XML-based configuration.

### Metadata Annotations

- **Purpose:** Provide additional information about components at runtime, which can be used by DI containers or other parts of the system to manage behavior dynamically.
- **Examples:** 
  - **Java:** Annotations like `@Component` and `@Service` in Spring that indicate a class is a Spring-managed component.
  - **C#:** Attributes like `[Service]` or custom attributes that might be used to mark components for specific behaviors.

### Configuration Files

- **Purpose:** Externalize the configuration of components and their dependencies, allowing for changes without modifying the codebase.
- **Examples:** XML, JSON, or YAML files that describe how components should be instantiated, their lifecycle, and how they should be wired together.

### Considerations

- **Clarity and Consistency:** Descriptions should be clear, concise, and consistent across the system to ensure that they are accessible to all team members.
- **Maintainability:** Component descriptions should be easy to update as the system evolves, avoiding outdated documentation that can lead to confusion.
- **Accessibility:** Descriptions and documentation should be readily available to those who need them, ideally integrated into the development environment or accessible through project management tools.

## Běhová Podpora pro Práci S Komponentami

Runtime support for component management involves mechanisms that allow applications to dynamically discover, instantiate, configure, and wire components at runtime. This capability is fundamental in modern application frameworks and environments, offering significant advantages in terms of flexibility, modularity, and testability.

### Dependency Injection (DI) Frameworks

- **Functionality:** DI frameworks automate the process of providing components with the instances of the dependencies they require. This inversion of control (IoC) reduces coupling between components, making systems more modular and easier to test.
- **Examples:**
	- **.NET Core's built-in DI container:** Provides comprehensive support for registering components and their dependencies, with lifetime management (singleton, scoped, transient).
	- **Spring Framework for Java:** Offers advanced DI capabilities, aspect-oriented programming, and transaction management.
	- **Google Guice for Java:** A lightweight framework focusing on making dependency injection simple and efficient.

### Component Containers

- **Functionality:** Beyond simple DI, component containers may offer additional features such as lifecycle management, configuration, and dynamic service discovery.
- **Examples:**
	- **OSGi (Open Service Gateway initiative):** A Java framework for developing and deploying modular software programs and libraries.
	- **Docker:** While not a DI framework, Docker can be seen as a container system for microservices, managing the lifecycle of components across different environments.

### Reflection and Metadata

- **Role in Runtime Support:** Reflection and metadata annotations enable frameworks to inspect the properties, methods, and annotations of classes at runtime, facilitating automatic component discovery and wiring.
- **Usage:** This is heavily used in Java (with `java.lang.reflect` package) and C# (with attributes and the `System.Reflection` namespace) to implement DI and other runtime support features.

### Configuration and Properties Files

- **Functionality:** External configuration files (e.g., XML, JSON, YAML) or property files can be used to define the structure and dependencies of components outside the code, allowing for easy changes without recompilation.
- **Benefits:** Enhances the flexibility and adaptability of applications by allowing component configurations to be modified without altering the source code.

### Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)

- **Functionality:** AOP addresses concerns that cut across multiple components and layers of an application (e.g., logging, transaction management) by allowing them to be modularized into separate aspects.
- **Integration with Components:** Often integrated with DI frameworks to provide declarative ways to define how and where cross-cutting concerns should be applied.

### Event-Driven and Reactive Programming

- **Relevance:** Modern applications often require components to react to events or streams of data asynchronously. Runtime support for event-driven and reactive programming models enables components to be loosely coupled yet responsive to changes and data flows.
