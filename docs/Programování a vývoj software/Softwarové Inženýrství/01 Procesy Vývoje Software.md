# 01 Procesy Vývoje Software

## Základní Aktivity V Procesu Vývoje Software a Jejich Popis

### Sommerwille

- **Specification** - defining what the system should do. Where customers and engineers define the software that is to be produced and the constraints on its operation.
- **Development**, where the software is designed and programmed. defining the organization of the system and implementing the system
- **Validation**, checking that it does what the customer wants;
- **Evolution**, where the software is modified to reflect changing customer and market requirements.

## Plánem Řízené a Inkrementální Procesy Vývoje Software (model vodopád)

- **Plan-driven processes** are processes where all of the process activities are planned in advance and progress is measured against this plan.
- **The waterfall model**
	- Plan-driven model. Separate and distinct phases of specification and development.
- **Incremental development model**
	- Specification, development and validation are interleaved. May be plan-driven or agile.
	- Sometimes called adaptive model

### Waterfall Model

- **Requirements analysis and definition**
	- The system’s services, constraints, and goals are established by consultation with stakeholders, they are defined in detail and structures (analysis)
- **System and software design**
	- establishing an overall system architecture
	- identifying and describing the fundamental software system abstractions and their relationships
	- specification of interfaces and algorithms
- **Unit testing**
	- verifying that each unit meets its specification
- **Integration and system testing**
	- individual program units or programs are integrated and tested as a complete system
- **Operation and maintanence**
	- longest life cycle
	- correcting errors
	- improving the implementation of system units,
	- enhancing the system’s services as new requirements are discovered

## Agilní Vývoj Software

- In **agile processes**, planning is incremental and it is easier to change the process to reflect changing customer requirements.
