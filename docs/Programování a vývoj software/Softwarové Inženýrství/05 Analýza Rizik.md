## Identifikace Rizik

Identifying risks in software engineering involves recognizing potential problems that could threaten the success of a software project. This includes technical, project, organizational, and external risks.

### Techniques for Risk Identification

Several techniques can be employed to systematically identify risks:

- **Brainstorming**: Engaging the project team and stakeholders in brainstorming sessions to generate a list of potential risks based on their experience and knowledge of the project.
- **Checklists**: Utilizing pre-defined checklists developed from previous projects or industry standards to identify common risks.
- **Interviews**: Conducting interviews with team members, stakeholders, and experts to gather insights on potential risks.
- **SWOT Analysis**: Analyzing the project's Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats to identify risks.
- **Delphi Technique**: A structured communication technique that involves a panel of experts answering questionnaires in two or more rounds to converge on a common view regarding potential risks.

### Categories of Risks

Risks in software projects can generally be categorized into the following:

- **Technical Risks**: Related to technology and software, such as new technology, technical feasibility, integration challenges, and performance issues.
- **Project Risks**: Concerned with the management and control of the project, including project size, scope creep, resource availability, and schedule overruns.
- **Organizational Risks**: Involving organizational factors such as changes in funding, personnel turnover, and conflicts within the team.
- **External Risks**: Arising from outside the project, including regulatory changes, market competition, and economic conditions.

### Documenting Identified Risks

Once identified, risks should be documented in a risk register or a similar tool. This documentation should include:

- **Description of the Risk**: A clear description of each identified risk.
- **Category**: The category to which the risk belongs (technical, project, organizational, external).
- **Impact**: The potential impact of the risk on the project objectives.
- **Likelihood**: An estimation of how likely it is that the risk will occur.
- **Mitigation Strategies**: Initial thoughts on how to mitigate or manage the risk.

### Best Practices

- **Continuous Process**: Risk identification should be an ongoing activity throughout the project lifecycle, as new risks can emerge at any time.
- **Inclusive Approach**: Involve a broad range of stakeholders in the risk identification process to ensure a comprehensive identification of risks.
- **Prioritization**: After identification, risks should be prioritized based on their impact and likelihood to ensure that the most critical risks are managed first.

After identifying potential risks in a software project, the next step is to evaluate their severity, impact, and then prioritize them accordingly. This ensures that the project team can focus on high-priority risks that have the most significant potential to affect the project adversely.

### Assessing Risk Severity and Impact

Risk severity and impact assessment involve analyzing each identified risk to understand its potential consequences on the project's timeline, budget, scope, quality, and overall objectives.

- **Severity**: Refers to the extent of the damage or negative outcomes that could result if the risk materializes.
- **Impact**: Relates to the magnitude of the effect on the project, often categorized as High, Medium, or Low.

#### Techniques for Assessing Severity and Impact

- **Qualitative Analysis**: Involves subjective judgment to assess the impact and likelihood of risks based on experience and intuition.
- **Quantitative Analysis**: Utilizes numerical methods, such as Expected Monetary Value (EMV), to calculate the potential impact of risks in monetary terms.

### Prioritization of Risks

Once risks have been assessed, they need to be prioritized to focus on managing the most critical ones. Prioritization is typically based on the likelihood of occurrence and the impact on project objectives.

- **Risk Matrix**: A common tool used for prioritization. It plots the likelihood of each risk against its impact, categorizing risks into different priority levels.
- **Risk Score**: Calculated by multiplying the likelihood and impact scores, providing a numerical value that helps in comparing and prioritizing risks.

### Best Practices for Risk Assessment and Prioritization

- **Involve the Right Stakeholders**: Ensure that all relevant stakeholders are involved in the risk assessment process to leverage diverse insights and expertise.
- **Regular Review and Update**: Risk assessments should be an ongoing process, with regular reviews and updates as the project progresses and as new information becomes available.
- **Develop Mitigation Plans for High-Priority Risks**: Once risks are prioritized, develop detailed mitigation or contingency plans for those categorized as high priority.

### Example of Risk Prioritization

Consider a software development project facing the following risks:
- A: New technology with unknown stability (High Impact, High Likelihood)
- B: Key team member leaving (Medium Impact, Medium Likelihood)
- C: Delay in third-party component delivery (High Impact, Low Likelihood)

Using a risk matrix, Risk A would be prioritized highest due to its high impact and high likelihood, followed by Risk C (high impact but lower likelihood), and then Risk B (medium impact and likelihood).
