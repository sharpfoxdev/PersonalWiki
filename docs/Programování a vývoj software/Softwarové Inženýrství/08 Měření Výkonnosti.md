# 08 Měření Výkonnosti

## Nástroje pro Měření Výkonosti (performance Analysis Tools, Např. GProf)

Performance analysis tools are essential for diagnosing and optimizing software performance. They help identify parts of the code that are causing slow execution or consuming excessive resources.

### GProf

GProf is a performance analysis tool that provides information about the time complexity of each function in a program, allowing developers to identify and optimize performance bottlenecks.

- **How It Works**: GProf analyzes the program's execution by sampling function calls and execution times, then generates a report detailing the functions called and the time spent in each.
- **Usage**: Compile your program with `-pg` flag to enable profiling with GProf, run your program, and then use `gprof` command to generate the report.

```bash
gcc -pg myprogram.c -o myprogram
./myprogram
gprof myprogram gmon.out > analysis.txt
```

- **Output**: GProf provides a flat profile for function execution times and a call graph that shows the calling relationships between functions.

### Other Performance Analysis Tools

- **Valgrind**: An instrumentation framework for building dynamic analysis tools, including tools for memory leak detection, cache and branch prediction profiling, and thread error detectors.
- **Perf**: A performance analyzing tool in Linux, offering a rich set of commands to collect and analyze performance and trace data.
- **VisualVM**: A visual tool integrating several command-line JDK tools and lightweight profiling capabilities, designed for monitoring and troubleshooting Java applications.
- **Intel VTune Profiler**: An advanced profiler that provides rich insights into performance characteristics of applications, including those running on multicore and manycore processors.

### Best Practices for Using Performance Analysis Tools

- **Profile Early and Often**: Integrate performance analysis into your development cycle to catch performance issues early.
- **Focus on Significant Bottlenecks**: Prioritize optimization efforts on parts of the code that consume the most time or resources.
- **Use Multiple Tools**: Different tools can provide different insights into your application's performance. Combining tools may offer a more comprehensive understanding.
- **Understand the Metrics**: Familiarize yourself with the metrics provided by the tools, such as CPU time, memory usage, and cache misses, to effectively interpret the results.

## .NET Profiling

### Visual Studio Profiler

- **Description**: Integrated into Visual Studio, the Visual Studio Profiler provides comprehensive performance insights directly within the IDE. It supports performance analysis for CPU usage, memory usage, and database queries.
- **Key Features**:
    - **Performance Wizard**: Simplifies the process of starting a performance session.
    - **CPU Usage Tool**: Identifies functions that are using the most CPU time.
    - **Memory Usage Tool**: Helps detect memory leaks and inefficient memory usage.

### JetBrains dotTrace

- **Description**: dotTrace from JetBrains is a performance and memory profiler for .NET applications that can profile a wide range of .NET applications, including desktop, web, and test applications.
- **Key Features**:
    - **Line-by-line Profiling**: Provides detailed information down to the line of code.
    - **Multiple Profiling Modes**: Supports sampling, tracing, and timeline modes for various analysis needs.
    - **Integration with ReSharper**: Offers a smooth workflow for users of JetBrains ReSharper.

### JetBrains dotMemory

- **Description**: dotMemory by JetBrains focuses on memory profiling for .NET applications, offering insights into memory consumption and potential leaks.
- **Key Features**:
    - **Memory Traffic Analysis**: Helps identify excessive memory allocations.
    - **Automatic Inspections**: Detects common memory issues automatically.
    - **Rich Data Visualizations**: Offers various views for analyzing memory usage, including Object Graph and Sunburst Chart.
