# 03 Testování

## Model Procesu Testování Software

The software testing process typically follows a structured approach, which can be divided into several key phases:

### 1. Planning and Preparation

- **Test Planning**: Define the scope, objectives, and strategy of testing activities. This includes determining the resources required, roles and responsibilities, and the schedule for testing.
- **Test Design**: Based on the software requirements and specifications, design test cases that cover all aspects of the software to be tested. This includes defining the input data, expected outcomes, and test conditions.

### 2. Test Environment Setup

- Prepare the environment in which the testing will take place, including setting up hardware, software, network configurations, and any other necessary tools and resources.
- Ensure that the test environment closely mimics the production environment to achieve accurate testing results.

### 3. Test Execution

- Execute the designed test cases against the software to identify any defects or discrepancies from the expected outcomes.
- Log and document any issues or bugs found during the test execution phase.

### 4. Defect Tracking and Management

- Use a defect tracking system to manage reported bugs and issues, tracking their status from discovery through to resolution.
- Prioritize defects based on severity and impact, and allocate resources for their resolution.

### 5. Test Reporting and Evaluation

- Compile test results into a detailed test report that outlines the testing activities performed, coverage, the defects identified, and the overall quality of the software.
- Evaluate the software against the initial objectives and requirements to determine its readiness for release.

### 6. Test Closure

- Conduct a test closure meeting with the project team to review the test outcomes, lessons learned, and to officially conclude the testing phase.
- Archive test artifacts, such as test cases, test data, and reports, for future reference and compliance purposes.

### Best Practices in Software Testing Process

- **Early and Continuous Testing**: Begin testing early in the SDLC (software development lifecycle) and continue iteratively throughout the development process to identify and resolve issues sooner.
- **Risk-based Testing**: Prioritize testing efforts based on the risk assessment of software features to focus on the most critical areas.
- **Automated and Manual Testing**: Utilize both automated testing for repetitive tasks and manual testing for exploratory testing to ensure comprehensive test coverage.
- **Collaboration and Communication**: Foster close collaboration between developers, testers, and other stakeholders to ensure alignment and understanding of the software requirements and quality expectations.

## Fáze Testování (Development, Release, User testing)

### Development Testing

Development testing occurs during the software development process. It includes several types of testing aimed at identifying defects early when they are less costly to fix.

- **Unit Testing**: Focuses on individual components or units of code to ensure they work as intended.
- **Integration Testing**: Tests the interaction between integrated units or components to detect interface defects.
- **Static Analysis**: Involves analyzing code without executing it to find potential issues like syntax errors, type mismatches, memory leaks, etc.

### Release Testing

Release testing is conducted to evaluate the software's readiness for release. It verifies that the product meets the specified requirements and quality standards.

- **System Testing**: Tests the complete and integrated software to verify that it meets specified requirements.
- **Acceptance Testing**: Conducted to determine if the system satisfies the business requirements and is acceptable for delivery. It often includes:
	- **Alpha Testing**: Performed by internal teams before releasing the product to external users.
	- **Beta Testing**: Conducted with a limited number of external users to obtain feedback under real-world usage conditions.

### User Testing

User testing involves real users testing the software in a real environment. It aims to uncover usability issues and gather feedback from users about the software's functionality, ease of use, and overall experience.

- **Usability Testing**: Evaluates the software's user interface and user experience to ensure it's intuitive and user-friendly.
- **Exploratory Testing**: Encourages testers to explore, experiment, and navigate through the software without predefined test cases to discover unexpected behavior or bugs.
- **Crowdsourced Testing**: Leverages a community of testers to identify defects. It's particularly useful for testing applications in diverse environments and configurations.

### Best Practices Across Testing Phases

- **Early and Continuous Engagement**: Start testing early in the development cycle and continue testing regularly throughout all phases to identify and fix issues promptly.
- **Test Automation**: Automate repetitive and regression tests to save time and ensure consistency across test executions.
- **Feedback Loop**: Establish a strong feedback loop between testers and developers to quickly address and resolve identified issues.
- **Real-world Environment Testing**: Ensure that release and user testing phases simulate real-world usage conditions as closely as possible to uncover practical issues.

## Druhy Development Testování (Unit, Module, System Testing)

### Unit Testing

Unit testing focuses on the smallest parts of the software, typically individual functions or methods within classes. The primary goal is to ensure that each unit performs as expected in isolation from the rest of the system.

- **Characteristics**:
	- Highly granular and focused on a single functionality.
	- Usually written and maintained by developers who write the code.
	- Automated tools (e.g., JUnit for Java, NUnit for .NET, and pytest for Python) are commonly used to execute unit tests.

- **Benefits**:
	- Helps developers identify and fix bugs early in the development cycle.
	- Facilitates code refactoring and helps in documenting the code.

### Module Testing

Module testing, sometimes referred to as component testing, involves testing a group of related units together as a module. The aim is to verify the functionality and performance of specific parts of the software that are expected to work collectively.

- **Characteristics**:
	- Tests the interaction between units or a group of related functionalities.
	- Often requires stubs or drivers to simulate the interaction with other modules or parts of the system not yet developed.

- **Benefits**:
	- Ensures that modules work together as intended.
	- Identifies interface defects between units.

### System Testing

System testing is a high-level testing phase that evaluates the complete and integrated software system to verify that it meets specified requirements. It's conducted in an environment that closely mimics production.

- **Characteristics**:
	- Encompasses the entire system to validate its compliance with the requirements.
	- Includes both functional testing (to verify the software does what it's supposed to do) and non-functional testing (to evaluate performance, security, compatibility, etc.).

- **Benefits**:
	- Validates the software's end-to-end functionality.
	- Assesses the system's behavior under production-like circumstances.

### Best Practices Across Development Testing

- **Automate Where Possible**: Automating tests, especially unit and module tests, can significantly speed up the development process and ensure consistency in testing.
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Integrating testing into a CI pipeline allows for automatic test execution with every code commit, helping to catch and fix errors more quickly.
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Adopting a TDD approach, where tests are written before the code, can improve code quality and ensure that the software meets its requirements from the start.

## Test-driven Development

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is an iterative development process that involves writing a test for a piece of functionality before implementing it. The cycle of TDD includes three main steps, often referred to as the "Red-Green-Refactor" cycle.

### Red-Green-Refactor Cycle

1. **Red**: Write a test that defines a function or improvements of a function, which should fail initially since the functionality has not yet been implemented.
2. **Green**: Write the minimal amount of code necessary to pass the test. The focus here is on making the test pass as quickly as possible, adhering to the specified requirements.
3. **Refactor**: Once the test passes, refactor the code to improve its structure, readability, and performance while ensuring that the test still passes. This step eliminates redundancy and enhances code quality.

### Benefits of TDD

- **Improved Code Quality**: Writing tests first helps ensure that the codebase is thoroughly tested and leads to fewer bugs.
- **Better Design Decisions**: TDD encourages developers to think through the design before coding, leading to simpler, more modular designs.
- **Documentation**: Tests serve as live documentation that describes how the system behaves and how to use its API.
- **Confidence in Refactoring**: With a comprehensive suite of tests, developers can refactor code with confidence, knowing that tests will catch regressions.

### Implementing TDD

- **Start Small**: Begin with simple tests and incrementally add more complex tests as the software evolves.
- **Focus on Requirements**: Tests should be based on software requirements to ensure that the software does what it's supposed to do.
- **Automate Tests**: Use a testing framework appropriate for your programming language (e.g., JUnit for Java, pytest for Python) to automate the execution of tests.
- **Integrate with CI/CD**: Automating TDD tests within a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline ensures tests are run automatically with every code change.

### Challenges and Considerations

- **Learning Curve**: TDD requires a shift in mindset and practice, which can take time to adopt fully.
- **Initial Slowdown**: Writing tests before code can initially slow down development, but this is often offset by reduced maintenance and debugging time in the later stages.
- **Test Maintenance**: As the system evolves, tests need to be maintained and updated, which can add to the workload.

## Inspekce Softwarového Kódu

Code inspection, also known as code review, is a critical component of the software development lifecycle (SDLC) that involves a careful and detailed check of the source code by individuals other than the original author. The primary aim is to identify errors, enforce coding standards, and ensure quality before the code progresses further in the development process.

### Process of Code Inspection

1. **Preparation**: Before the inspection begins, reviewers familiarize themselves with the codebase and the specific segments of code to be reviewed. Documentation, coding standards, and guidelines are also reviewed.

2. **Meeting**: The inspection often involves a formal meeting where the code is examined by the reviewers. The author of the code may explain the logic and decisions behind the code segments.

3. **Review**: Reviewers systematically go through the code, looking for errors, possible improvements, and adherence to coding standards. Tools can also be used to automate some aspects of the review process.

4. **Reporting**: Findings from the code inspection are documented, including bugs, potential improvements, and non-adherence to standards.

5. **Follow-up**: The code author addresses the findings, making necessary corrections or improvements. The code may undergo subsequent reviews until it meets the required standards.

### Types of Issues Identified

- **Logical Errors**: Mistakes in the code that could lead to incorrect behavior or results.
- **Performance Issues**: Code that may cause inefficiency or slow performance.
- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Weaknesses that could be exploited for unauthorized access or data breaches.
- **Non-Compliance with Standards**: Code that does not follow the predefined coding standards and conventions.

### Benefits of Code Inspection

- **Improved Code Quality**: Helps in identifying and fixing errors early in the development process.
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Promotes learning and knowledge transfer among team members as they discuss code logic and practices.
- **Reduced Development Cost**: Detecting defects early reduces the cost associated with fixing them later in the development cycle.
- **Enhanced Security**: Identifies security vulnerabilities that could be exploited if left unchecked.

### Best Practices for Code Inspection

- **Regularly Schedule Inspections**: Incorporate code reviews into the regular development cycle to ensure continuous improvement.
- **Foster a Positive Environment**: The focus should be on the code, not the coder. Reviews should be constructive, aiming to improve the code and develop the team's skills.
- **Use Automated Tools**: Incorporate static analysis tools to automate part of the inspection process, allowing reviewers to focus on more complex issues.
